# 3: Logistic regression

```{r}

date()

```

First reading in the data that got wrangled before and exploring the structure and the dimensions of the data frame.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

alc <- read.csv("data/alc.csv")

# print out the variable names of the data set
colnames(alc)

```
